We started playing around with Android when Android Studio was 0.3.6 and now it's hit [stable 1.0](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2014/12/android-studio-10.html)!  We prefer it to Eclipse and other solutions because of its native [Gradle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-build.html) support and some unique features that the visual design and testing process.  For now, we stay on the 'Beta' channel that updates every couple of weeks.
